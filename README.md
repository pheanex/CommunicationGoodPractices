## 1. Read and Acknowledge Messages Promptly  
   Promptly read and respond to direct messages and tagged messages/threads.
   At the very least, acknowledge receipt with an emoji or brief reply if you can't respond immediately (e.g., “Got it, will respond in an hour”). Direct mentions require a reply by the end of the day (unless you’re out of the office).

## 2. Keep Notifications ON  
   Ensure your notifications are enabled so that you stay reachable for urgent matters. Customize your notification settings, such as sound alerts, to ensure you’re alerted only for personal messages or specific channels. Reasonable adjustments are allowed (e.g., when you are presenting in a meeting and need to mute notifications), but the general rule is to ensure that you’re reachable during your business hours when you’re not in meetings or focus time.

## 3. Choose Threads Over Chaos  
   Responding to messages within a thread, rather than creating a new message in a channel, confines the discussion and prevents cluttering the entire channel with unrelated chatter. It also makes it easier to review the conversation in the future.

## 4. Use the Search Function/History  
   Before asking a question, particularly regarding a feature or process that has been in existence for a while (6+ months), try searching for it in the history. There is a chance that it has already been asked and answered.

## 5. Lend a Helping Hand  
   If you come across a question in channels with high cross-team and customer collaboration that appears to be a significant blocker for someone, consider responding or tagging the appropriate individual/team, even if you haven't been directly tagged but you know the answer or who can provide it.

## 6. Use Appropriate Channels and Tags  
   When you have a question or need feedback on a topic specific to a particular domain, post it in the relevant channel or tag the appropriate team handles in broader channels. Make sure to accurately target your messages to the relevant audience. If you need broader feedback, such as for surveys, coordinate with managers to facilitate participation within their respective teams. While Slack serves as our main channel for communication between individuals, it isn’t a tool for tracking requests or queries for a specific group. For such items, make sure to use the established process (Jira and others) for the given function.

## 7. Avoid a Mass Broadcast  
   Refrain from using @here, @channel, @all in public channels as much as possible. There are cases when it may be needed, but the standard practice is that users are encouraged to check such channels daily for all updates at a convenient time for them.

## 8. Opt for Channels for Project Matters  
   When addressing project-related matters, refrain from using private messages as they are prone to be overlooked and raise the bus factor unnecessarily. Keep all conversations on channels (dedicated to a project, a team channel, or a functional channel). This ensures that relevant context is readily available whenever involvement from others is required.

## 9. Craft Meaningful & Informative Messages  
    Before sending a message, ask yourself, “Will the person be able to give me a satisfactory answer based on the context that I’ve shared?”. It’s a win-win situation - you will avoid message ping pong and get your answer faster. It will also be less demanding for the recipient. Remember to do some investigation on your own beforehand to understand the issue or at least build some context about the problem to ask for more specific help.

## 10. Ping People with a Reminder if Needed  
    Don’t hesitate to ping people. Sometimes they just forget and would actually appreciate a reminder. It’s not - and shouldn’t be - taken as impolite to be respectfully pinged about a matter, especially if it’s important.

## 11. Be Mindful of the Context and Share It  
    When you bring someone into an already long thread, make sure to include a quick recap of the main points and what input exactly is needed from them, so they don't have to read the entire conversation.

## 12. Consider Consultant vs. Contributor  
    Many people may get pinged as part of long conversations, so try to limit pinging multiple users in a thread for specific conversation segments, especially if it already has a lot of participants and context. Instead, consider soliciting individual input outside the thread as necessary, treating others as consultants to minimize excessive notifications.

## 13. Keep Your Status Up to Date  
    To ensure others can anticipate your responsiveness based on your status (away, out of office, online), update it as necessary. To reduce the manual effort, try using integrations with your calendar so it automatically sets your status to unavailable during meetings. Consistently displaying an "away" status on Slack is discouraged.
