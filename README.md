## 1. Use the Search Function/History
    Before asking a question, search for conversations on the topic. It may have been asked and answered. If something remains unanswered or additional input is needed, add to that thread, as the context is set, saving retyping, and helping others find relevant information. This may lead to an answer sooner without requiring additional attention.

## 2. Effective Notification Setup
    Adjust notification settings to notice all pings and mentions, especially urgent ones, while distinguishing them from less important messages. This reduces unnecessary messages, notifications, and reminders.

## 3. Acknowledge and Respond Promptly
    Timely read, acknowledge and respond to direct messages and threads that tag you or your group. Delays may block the sender or cause them to send unnecessary reminders and messages to other potentially wrong audiences.
Acknowledgement with an emoji is easy, fast and encouraged.

## 4. Use Threads
    Respond within a thread, rather than creating a new message on the same level. Doing so confines the conversation and makes it easier to follow, link to and search for later.

## 5. Help Direct Unanswered Queries
    When a question seems to be blocking someone, tag the correct audience or refer them to the correct channel or tool if you know who can provide the answer. This may help the sender get a response sooner and guide them to a more suitable audience for future messages, reducing noise.

## 6. Use Appropriate Tools, Channels and Tags
    Learn which tool (Slack, Jira, Confluence, etc.), channel, and tag best suit your message. This can lead to answers sooner from the right sources, minimizing unnecessary notifications to unrelated recipients and making it easier for others to rediscover the information later by placing it in the proper context.

## 7. Avoid Broadcast  
    Use @here, @channel, and @all sparingly, especially in channels with many recipients. Instead, opt for more specific channels and mentions. Broad, unspecified messages to large groups often fail to motivate individuals to respond, may result in too many replies, and create unnecessary notifications.

## 8. Avoid Private Messages
    Instead of reaching out to individuals through private messages, consider asking in a more inclusive or open channel. This makes it easier to involve others, allows more recipients to respond and learn from the conversation (reducing the need for repeated questions and notifications), and helps distribute the load, reducing pressure on individuals.

## 9. Avoid Delays, Give Details
	Ensure your message includes all necessary information so recipients can answer immediately without needing to ask follow-up questions. This can prevent back-and-forth exchanges, reduce notifications, and lead to answers sooner.

## 10. Send Reminders
	Don't hesitate to ping people for unacknowledged or unanswered messages to ensure you get the needed response. They may have forgotten and appreciate the reminder.

## 11. Involve New Participants Effectively
	When adding someone to a long conversation, summarize the main points and clarify what is needed from them. This can expedite their input by saving them from reading lengthy, potentially unnecessary conversations.

## 12. Avoid Overloading Conversations
	When possible, limit the number of people added to long conversations, especially if many are involved. If additional input is needed or a related topic arises, consider creating a new thread instead. Link the threads to maintain context. This approach reduces unnecessary notifications and makes conversations easier to follow and discover.

## 13. Update Your Profile Status
	To help others anticipate your responsiveness, keep your status (away, out of office, online) updated as needed. This reduces unnecessary notifications and reminders. Calendar integrations can automate this process.

## 14. Take Action on Unwanted Notifications
	When receiving irrelevant notifications, guide the sender to the correct audience, provide feedback to stop unwanted messages, or unsubscribe from unnecessary topics, channels, or handles. Every notification should be relevant to avoid information overload and ensure important information isn't missed.
